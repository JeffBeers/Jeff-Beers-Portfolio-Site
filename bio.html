        <h2>Biography</h2>
            <!--<img src="img/tubaHeadshot1.JPG" alt="Jeff with his tuba"> -->
                
                <p>My name is Jeff Beers, and I am a musician living in Louisville, Kentucky. I started playing tuba when I was 10 years old for my grade school’s concert band. When I was 14, I started playing electric bass with several high school rock bands. The combination of formal music education at school on tuba, and the informal creation of music with my friends on bass is what drove my passion for music at a young age. I went on to get a bachelor’s degree in music performance from Southern Illinois University in 2014, and then a master’s degree in music performance from the University of Louisville in 2018.</p>
                
                <p>I currently play tuba with the Southern Illinois Music Festival as the principal tubist, Chamber Winds Louisville Concert Band, Old Lou’s Ragtime Band, and Boom Pah Pah polka band. As a freelance tuba player, I am regularly called for other New Orleans jazz bands, dixieland bands, and church services.</p>
                    
                <p>I also play bass with the Usual Suspects Bands in Louisville, Singer-Songwriter Josh Murphy, and have collaborated in multiple socially distanced recording projects since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
